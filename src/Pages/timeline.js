                        There was tension and uneasiness in unfamiliarity. There was something distinct & powerful between the two. They could not seem to see eye-to-eye, or find many similiarities in each other. But there is something marvelous and warm about two strangers crossing lines, stepping into somthing new and unfamiliar. A night was spent under the covers.

                      On September 6 2023, something brought the two together again. Its thought the world knew they needed each other. Curry was made and a joint was not smoked. They slept nose to nose. Something was started that night that wouldn't be easy to shake.

                       Sunsets were watched on roofs, parks were ventured, acid was taken. I felt my soul bleeding into you, aching for yours. I knew it wasn't one sided. The two batteled through internal and external conflict, moral and ethic dilema. Two big egos, one big choice.

                      I knew there was something about you that brought out such good in me. We don't just spend time together. We grow. We learn. We make each other better people, we make efforts to understand and love one another. Nothing about this connection is passive, its active, its fiery.

                  We pinned boutonni√®res on each other at prom, lived the sweetheart night fantasty, forever coating over prom as a wondrous memory in my mind. Our outfits blended perfect, oh how well we complement each other. Dancing with you, watching your body move, I love to be with you in the center of a room. A great hall. I remember walking to prom, and the things we talked about. We should take walks more often.

                  On December 3 2023, I told you I loved you. It came out of me as we held each other in the middle of your room, somewhere I love being, despite always feeling most comfortable in my own spaces. You looked so beautiful that day, I'll forever have those images of you. The way the sunlight hit you, the way tears shined on your cheeks. I am shook left speechless by your beauty, the beauty you bring out of me. Somehow together we are so simple, but so so complex.

                  A journey neither could believe was about to be embarked on. Blinded by trust and love, barriers of continents were shattered, that is how far this love spans.

You make me feel like so much. I've never felt small with you.
